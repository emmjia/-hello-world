Just another repository
Hello, my name is Emmanuel. I am a novice when it comes to coding but I would say I am very proficient in RStudio.
A program that allows Statisticians to analyze large dataset. I am very well familiar with machine learning, linear gregression, categorical analysis, and design/analysis of experiments. 

As of now I am trying to be well familiar with GitHub and SQL to be a well rounded data scientist.

:)
